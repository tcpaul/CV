Slightly modified version of Adrien Friggeri's CV, 
where Helvetica Neue font was replaced with OpenSans, Roboto and 
Liberation families.

Original description:
Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Helvetica and using colors 
inspired by Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in 
black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if 
printing on paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use 
Helvetica Neue, biblatex to print my publications and 
textpos for the aside.
